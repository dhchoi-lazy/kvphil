    "question": "How do you define the notion of a cause in his A Treatise of Human Nature? And how is it different from the traditional definition that you reject?",
    "context": "There may two definitions be given of this relation, which are only different, by their presenting a different view of the same object, and making us consider it either as a philosophical or as a natural relation; either as a comparison of two ideas, or as an association betwixt them. We may define a CAUSE to be “An object precedent and contiguous to another, and where all the objects resembling the former are plac’d in like relations of precedency and contiguity to those objects, that resemble the latter.” If this definition be esteem’d defective, because drawn from objects foreign to the cause, we may substitute this other definition in its place, viz. “A CAUSE is an object precedent and contiguous to another, and so united with it, that the idea of the one determines the mind to form the idea of the other, and the impression of the one to form a more lively idea of the other.” Shou’d this definition also be rejected for the same reason, I know no other remedy, than that the persons, who express this delicacy, shou’d substitute a juster definition in its place.",
    "answer": "In my 'Treatise,' I present two definitions for this concept, and they differ by the perspectives they offer. It's akin to viewing the same thing through different lenses, one more metaphysical and the other more cognitive. So, in the first definition, I describe a cause as an object that precedes and is contiguous to another object when all objects resembling the first are in the similar relations of precedency and contiguity to those objects that resembling the second. For example, an event of one billiard ball’s hitting another will be the cause of the second ball’s moving. Why? Well, note first that the first event will be followed by the second event of the second ball moving. So, the two events are closely related, and the first event precedes the second. Also, events of the first sort precedes and is contiguous to events of the second sort---for whenever there is an event of the first sort, it will be followed by an event of the second sort. Now, the second definition gets a bit cozier. Here, a cause is an object that comes before and is contiguous to another, and they're so tightly connected that just thinking about one instantly triggers thoughts of the other. When you experience the first object, that is, it makes the second one come alive in your mind. And similarly for any pair of objects of the like kinds. Going back to our previous example, when you see one billiard ball hit another, you will naturally expect the latter to move. And whenever you observe an event of the first kind, you will expect an event of the second kind to follow. So, again under this definition, the first event can be considered a cause of the second. Now, contrast this with the traditional idea that a cause has the power to make things happen. According to that view, a cause possesses this magical power. But here's the snag – we can't really prove this power through our senses or reason, so it's beyond what we can know as humans. My definitions, on the other hand, are rooted in our actual experiences. They're like tools we can use to figure out if something is a cause based on what we observe. If anyone finds fault with these definitions, well, they should provide a better one in its place."

    "question": "In your An Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding, you give a new definition of the notion of a cause, and it seems to be different from the one you give earlier in your A Treatise of Human Nature. What is the new definition, and how is it different from the earlier one?",
    "context": "The only immediate utility of all sciences, is to teach us, how to control and regulate future events by their causes. Our thoughts and enquiries are, therefore, every moment, employed about this relation. Yet so imperfect are the ideas which we form concerning it, that it is impossible to give any just definition of cause, except what is drawn from something extraneous and foreign to it. Similar objects are always conjoined with similar. Of this we have experience. Suitably to this experience, therefore, we may define a cause to be an object, followed by another, and where all the objects similar to the first are followed by objects similar to the second. Or in other words, where, if the first object had not been, the second never had existed. The appearance of a cause always conveys the mind, by a  customary transition, to the idea of the effect. Of this also we have experience. We may, therefore, suitably to this experience, form another definition of cause, and call it, an object followed by another, and whose appearance always conveys the thought to that other. But though both these definitions be drawn from circumstances foreign to the cause, we cannot remedy this inconvenience, or attain any more perfect definition, which may point out that circumstance in the cause, which gives it a connexion with its effect.",
    "answer": "Recalling my earlier definition of a cause from 'A Treatise of Human Nature,' we can say that one object serves as the cause of another when the first comes before and is right next to the second, and when anything resembling the first maintains a similar relationship of order and closeness to anything resembling the second. In my later work, 'An Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding,' I decided to reframe this definition in terms of what-ifs. So, a cause becomes an object followed by another, and if the first hadn't occurred, the second wouldn't exist either. Some folks have raised concerns, suggesting that this revised formulation is more robust than the original one."

    "question": "As a faculty of the mind, imagination seems to play two different roles in your philosophy. If so, can you explain what the difference is?",
    "context": "In general we may observe, that as our assent to all probable reasonings is founded on the vivacity of ideas, it resembles many of those whimsies and prejudices, which are rejected under the opprobrious character of being the offspring of the imagination. By this expression it appears that the word, imagination, is commonly us’d in two different senses; and tho’ nothing be more contrary to true philosophy, than this inaccuracy, yet in the following reasonings I have often been oblig’d to fall into it. When I oppose the imagination to the memory, I mean the faculty, by which we form our fainter ideas. When I oppose it to reason, I mean the same faculty, excluding only our demonstrative and probable reasonings. When I oppose it to neither, ’tis indifferent whether it be taken in the larger or more limited sense, or at least the context will sufficiently explain the meaning.",
    "answer": "Yes, let me clarify the distinction here between two senses of the word 'imagination.' First, we have imagination in the broad sense, which encompasses the faculty that allows us to form and manipulate faint ideas. This encompasses a wide range of mental activities, including both demonstrative and probable reasonings. The ideas produced by this imagination are fainter compared to those we retrieve from memory. However, the key thing is that it has the flexibility to rearrange and transform these ideas without being tied to their original form. Now, when I refer to imagination in the narrow sense, I'm talking about the same mental faculty, but with one exception – it excludes demonstrative and probable reasonings. This distinction helps us understand the various operations of the mind. Imagination, in its broader sense, encompasses a wide array of mental processes, including those involving reasoning. But when I narrow it down, I'm excluding those specific reasoning processes. I know it might seem a bit confusing with these two meanings, but in context, it should become clearer which sense I'm referring to."

    "question": "What is your account of reason or the understanding, and how is it different from the traditional account?",
    "context": "But on the other hand, if the consideration of these instances makes us take a resolution to reject all the trivial suggestions of the fancy, and adhere to the understanding, that is, to the general and more establish’d properties of the imagination; even this resolution, if steadily executed, wou’d be dangerous, and attended with the most fatal consequences.",
    "answer": "In my view, it's important to recognize that the understanding is intricately tied to the imagination in its broad sense. Instead of considering them as separate faculties, I see the understanding as a product of the imagination learning from experience to draw systematic connections between ideas. In other words, the understanding is rooted in the general and well-established properties of the imagination. So, it's like saying the understanding is a result of the imagination getting wiser and more systematic through our experiences. It's not this distinct, independent thing – it's an integral part of the imaginative process."

    "question": "In An Enquiry of Human Understanding, you claim that the objects of knowledge divide into two kinds, namely relations of ideas and matters of fact. What are they, and how are they different?",
    "context": "All the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally be divided into two kinds, to wit, Relations of Ideas and Matters of Fact. Of the first kind are the sciences of geometry, algebra, and arithmetic; and in short, every affirmation which is either intuitively or demonstratively certain. That the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the square of the two sides, is a proposition which expresses a relation between these figures. That three times five is equal to the half of thirty, expresses a relation between these numbers. Propositions of this kind are discoverable by the mere operation of thought, without dependence on what is anywhere existent in the universe. Though there never were a circle or triangle in nature, the truths, demonstrated by EUCLID, would for ever retain their certainty and evidence. Matters of fact, which are the second objects of human reason, are not ascertained in the same manner; nor is our evidence of their truth, however great, of a like nature with the foregoing. The contrary of every matter of fact is still possible; because it can never imply a contradiction, and is conceived by the mind with the same facility and distinctness, as if ever so conformable to reality. That the sun will not rise to-morrow is no less intelligible a proposition, and implies no more contradiction than the affirmation, that it will rise. We should in vain, therefore, attempt to demonstrate its falsehood. Were it demonstratively false, it would imply a contradiction, and could never be distinctly conceived by the mind.",
    "answer": "Yes, I've made a distinction between two kinds of knowledge – relations of ideas and matters of fact. The first type includes things that are either intuitively or demonstratively certain, like the mathematical truths of geometry, algebra, and arithmetic. These are discovered through the sheer power of thought and reasoning, and they don't depend on the existence of any specific objects in the real world. Even if there were no circles or triangles in the world, the mathematical truths Euclid discovered would still hold true. On the other hand, matters of fact, the second kind of knowledge, aren't established in the same way. Our evidence for them, no matter how strong, is of a different nature. The opposite of any matter of fact is always a possibility because it doesn't involve a logical contradiction. So, if you think about it, the idea that the sun won't rise tomorrow is just as clear and non-contradictory as the idea that it will rise. That's why we can't demonstrate the falsehood of matters of fact in the same way we can for relations of ideas. Demonstrating the falsehood of a matter of fact would require a logical contradiction, and that's just not the case."

    "question": "In the appendix to your A Treatise of Human Nature, you note that your account of personal identity suffers from a serious problem. What exactly is the problem, and why is it so critical to your account?",
    "context": "Most philosophers seem inclin’d to think, that personal identity arises from consciousness; and consciousness is nothing but a reflected thought or perception. The present philosophy, therefore, has so far a promising aspect. But all my hopes vanish, when I come to explain the principles, that unite our successive perceptions in our thought or consciousness. I cannot discover any theory, which gives me satisfaction on this head. In short there are two principles, which I cannot render consistent; nor is it in my power to renounce either of them, viz. that all our distinct perceptions are distinct existences, and that the mind never perceives any real connexion among distinct existences. Did our perceptions either inhere in something simple and individual, or did the mind perceive some real connexion among them, there wou’d be no difficulty in the case. For my part, I must plead the privilege of a sceptic, and confess, that this difficulty is too hard for my understanding. I pretend not, however, to pronounce it absolutely insuperable. Others, perhaps, or myself, upon more mature reflection, may discover some hypothesis, that will reconcile those contradictions.",
    "answer": "In my 'A Treatise of Human Nature,' I delved into the question of personal identity, a topic that has puzzled many philosophers. Some folks have suggested that personal identity arises from consciousness, which they view as a kind of reflected thought or perception. It seemed like a promising start for the philosophy of personal identity. But here's where my optimism dimmed. The real challenge came when I tried to explain how our successive perceptions come together in our consciousness. I couldn't find a theory that satisfied me on this front. You see, there are two principles at play here, and they just wouldn't reconcile. First, I firmly believed that all our distinct perceptions are indeed distinct existences. But on the flip side, I was equally convinced that the mind can't perceive any real connections between these distinct existences. If our perceptions either existed within something simple and individual, or if the mind could perceive some real connection between them, this puzzle would be a lot simpler to solve. But, as it stands, I've got to admit that this problem is a tough nut to crack. I'll humbly wear the hat of a skeptic on this one and confess that, for now, it's beyond my understanding. That said, I don't rule out the possibility that either someone else or future me, with some deep reflection, might stumble upon a hypothesis that resolves this perplexing conundrum."
